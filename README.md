Install Ruby 2.6+, Node.JS and yarn (ðŸ™„)
Then Ruby gems `bundle install`
Then Javascript libs `rails webpacker:install`
Copy the .env.sample file to .env and change it with actual twitter credentials:
```
TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY=xxx
TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET=xxx
```

This should be enough to `rails s`
